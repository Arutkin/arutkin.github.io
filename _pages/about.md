I am a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Shlomi Reuveni at Tel Aviv University, specializing in stochastic processes and first passage time theory. My research investigates the dynamics of complex systems, with applications in fields such as epidemiology and AI-driven biology. With a background in both physics and financial mathematics, I develop mathematical models to better understand how these systems behave.
